"""Spring-smooth a rigid racket without letting it stretch, shear, or flip.

The body twin is shown two ways in `test_6_compare.blend` — raw and spring-smoothed
(0.12 s, about -85% jitter) — and until now the racket drawn on both was the same
unsmoothed series, so the "smooth" twin carried a jittery racket. This module produces the
smoothed counterpart using the same filter, so the comparison is honest on both halves.

Why not just smooth the three points
------------------------------------
`racket_grip`, `racket_head` and `racket_side` are not independent: the racket is one rigid
object, so grip-to-head is a fixed length and side-to-head a fixed half-width perpendicular
to the shaft. Filtering the three points separately would let the racket stretch and shear
by a few millimetres every frame — small, but it turns a rigid body into a wobbling one.

Instead the racket is decomposed into the quantities that are actually free — grip position,
shaft direction, and the width direction — each smoothed, then recomposed at the original
fixed length and width. Rigidity is preserved by construction rather than by luck.

The width direction needs one extra step: `w` and `-w` describe the same physical racket
(the head is symmetric, and `left`/`right` are interchangeable), so the raw sequence can
contain sign flips that mean nothing. Smoothing through one would swing the vector through
zero and collapse the racket's plane. Signs are aligned along the sequence first.

This module is deliberately numpy-only: it is imported by `tools/blender/racket_viewer.py`
inside Blender, where the CV tools (mediapipe, cv2) do not exist.

    exactly. This is offline data, so there is no reason to pay for lag: a single causal
    pass at tau=0.12 s lags by 2 frames (80 ms), and during the smash the racket head moves
    at 8.8 m/s — 80 ms of lag would drag it most of a metre behind the hand holding it.
    Measured on white noise at 25 fps, tau=0.12 s: **93% reduction in frame-to-frame
    jitter** (std of successive differences) with **zero residual lag** — the same causal
    pass alone gives 59% and lags 2.5 frames. Note those two numbers measure different
    things: jitter is a high-frequency metric, and RMS error against the true trajectory
    falls by only about half, because tau=0.12 s at 25 fps averages just a few frames.

    `valid` (optional bool array) marks frames carrying real values. Invalid frames pass
    through untouched and reset the filter state, so real motion is never dragged toward
